## What is Nunjucks?

Nunjucks is a powerful templating engine for JavaScript, created by Mozilla. It is similar to Jinja2 (a templating engine for Python) and designed to work in server-side environments like Node.js as well as client-side in the browser. It enables developers to separate HTML from logic, making web development cleaner and more maintainable.
